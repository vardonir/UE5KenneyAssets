# UE5KenneyAssets
Kenney's 3D Assets, converted for use in UE5

Scaled to a somewhat reasonable size, deleted the collision meshes, replaced materials with material instances, saved as uassets.

Should just be drag and drop into your project.

Available packs:
* [Furniture Kit](https://kenney.nl/assets/furniture-kit) v1.0

More available as I get around to it.
